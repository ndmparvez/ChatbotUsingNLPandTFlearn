# ChatbotUsingNLPandTFlearn
Chatbot that Understands the Context of Sentence and Respond accordingly.
AI ChatBot using Python Tensorflow and Natural Language Processing (NLP) along side TFLearn.
This Chatbot is exclusively based for a Hotel Booking and info site.

Things that we are going to do in this Project:

->Transforming the Conversational Intents into Tensorflow model (Neural Network using TFLEARN) using NLP and Save it as Pickle also.
->Load the Same Pickle and Model to Build the Framework to Process the Responses.
->At Last, We Show How the Inputs are Processed and Give the Reponses.
